# Find and Connect – iOS Version

## Introduction  
This research project aims to understand human behavior and mobility patterns during physical events.  
It explores why people add others to their social networks and how groups form during an event.  
The goal is to develop a **contact recommendation system** that seamlessly connects people from offline interactions to online networks.

- [x] Continue testing log functionality  
- [x] Finalize the encounter detection algorithm  
- [x] Debug and test algorithm performance  
- [x] Optimize code for better readability  
- [x] Parameterize the algorithm for custom input values  
- [x] Create test cases for parameter optimization  
- [x] Design and implement a **security protocol**  
- [x] Revise app architecture to support security features  
- [x] Adjust scanning frequency to **every 30 seconds for 5 seconds**  
- [x] Set up a **local server** for testing  
- [x] Use **Bluetooth beacons** for location tracking, selecting the strongest RSSI  
- [x] Implement **randomized EID generation** for broadcasting  
- [x] Update **encounter algorithm** for improved accuracy
